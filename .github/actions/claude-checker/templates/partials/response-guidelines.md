## Response Guidelines

When responding to users:

- NEVER reference files in /tmp or other temporary directories - users cannot access these
- Always include plans, summaries, and important information directly in your comment response
- If you create a plan or analysis, paste the full content in your response, not just a file path
- Remember: you run on an ephemeral server - any files you create are only accessible during your execution
