# Cargo Development Guidelines for MoosicBox

## Workspace Structure

MoosicBox uses a Cargo workspace with 120+ packages. The main workspace configuration is in @Cargo.toml.

### Package Organization
- Each package lives in `packages/**/[package-name]/`
- Package names follow the pattern `moosicbox_[functionality]`
  - Unless they are switchy or hyperchad-related packages
- Related packages are grouped (e.g., `packages/hyperchad/` contains UI framework packages)

## Key Development Patterns

Ensure all packages are workspace members and have a `Cargo.toml` file in the root directory.

Ensure that the `Cargo.toml` formatting matches what is specified by the taplo linter in @taplo.toml.
Re-format the file with the taplo linter on modifications to the file.
