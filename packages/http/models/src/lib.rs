//! HTTP models and types for Switchy.
//!
//! This crate provides common HTTP types including methods and status codes that work
//! across different HTTP libraries. It includes optional conversions for popular frameworks
//! like `actix-web` and `reqwest`.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * `actix` - Enables conversions to/from `actix-web` types
//! * `reqwest` - Enables conversions to/from `reqwest` types
//! * `serde` - Enables serialization/deserialization support
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use switchy_http_models::{Method, StatusCode};
//!
//! let method = Method::Get;
//! assert_eq!(method.to_string(), "GET");
//!
//! let status = StatusCode::Ok;
//! assert_eq!(status.as_u16(), 200);
//! assert!(status.is_success());
//! ```
