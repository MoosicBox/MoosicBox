## Code Walkthrough

### Example 1: Thread-Local Cancellation

Demonstrates basic cancellation using `run_until_simulation_cancelled()`:

```rust
// Reset cancellation state for clean start
reset_simulator_cancellation_token();

// Spawn a task that will cancel after 250ms
spawn(async {
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(250)).await;
    cancel_simulation();
});

// Run simulation until cancelled
let result = run_until_simulation_cancelled(async {
    simulate_work(1, 1000).await
}).await;
```

The `run_until_simulation_cancelled()` function races the provided future against cancellation tokens, returning `None` if cancelled or `Some(output)` if completed.

### Example 2: Global Cancellation

Shows how global cancellation affects multiple concurrent tasks:

```rust
reset_global_simulator_cancellation_token();

// Spawn multiple tasks
let task1 = spawn(async {
    run_until_simulation_cancelled(async {
        simulate_work(2, 1500).await
    }).await
});

let task2 = spawn(async {
    run_until_simulation_cancelled(async {
        simulate_work(3, 1500).await
    }).await
});

// Trigger global cancellation
cancel_global_simulation();
```

Global cancellation triggers the `GLOBAL_SIMULATOR_CANCELLATION_TOKEN`, which affects all threads and all tasks using `run_until_simulation_cancelled()`.

### Example 3: Manual Cancellation Checks

Demonstrates manual cancellation checking for fine-grained control:

```rust
loop {
    // Check thread-local cancellation
    if is_simulator_cancelled() {
        println!("Detected thread-local cancellation");
        break;
    }

    // Check global cancellation
    if is_global_simulator_cancelled() {
        println!("Detected global cancellation");
        break;
    }

    // Do work...
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(50)).await;
}
```

This pattern is useful when integrating with existing code or when you need explicit control over cancellation points.

### Example 4: Reset and Multiple Runs

Shows how to reset cancellation state for sequential simulation runs:

```rust
for run in 1..=3 {
    // Critical: Reset state before each run
    reset_simulator_cancellation_token();
    reset_global_simulator_cancellation_token();

    let result = run_until_simulation_cancelled(async {
        simulate_work(10 + run, 200).await
    }).await;
}
```

Resetting cancellation tokens is essential when running multiple simulations to ensure each starts with clean state.

## Key Concepts

### Thread-Local vs. Global Cancellation

- **Thread-Local**: Affects only the current thread's simulation. Use `cancel_simulation()` and `is_simulator_cancelled()`.
- **Global**: Affects all threads and simulations across the entire process. Use `cancel_global_simulation()` and `is_global_simulator_cancelled()`.

### Cancellation Token Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Tokens are automatically created on first use
2. **Triggering**: Call `cancel_simulation()` or `cancel_global_simulation()`
3. **Checking**: Use `is_simulator_cancelled()` or `is_global_simulator_cancelled()`
4. **Resetting**: Call `reset_simulator_cancellation_token()` or `reset_global_simulator_cancellation_token()` to prepare for new runs

### Worker Thread IDs

Each thread gets a unique, monotonically increasing ID via `worker_thread_id()`. This is useful for:

- Debugging multi-threaded simulations
- Logging and tracing
- Thread-specific behavior

### Graceful Shutdown

The `run_until_simulation_cancelled()` function enables graceful shutdown by racing your future against cancellation tokens. When cancellation is triggered:

1. The future is dropped
2. `None` is returned to indicate cancellation
3. Resources are cleaned up automatically

## Testing the Example

The example is self-contained and runs automatically. To verify behavior:

1. **Observe cancellation timing**: Tasks should be interrupted mid-execution
2. **Check thread IDs**: Multiple spawned tasks will show different thread IDs
3. **Verify reset behavior**: Example 4 should complete all three runs successfully
4. **Monitor output**: Each example should print expected cancellation messages

You can modify timing values in the code to experiment with different cancellation scenarios:

```rust
// In example_1_thread_local_cancellation()
sleep(Duration::from_millis(250)).await; // Try different values
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks completing before cancellation

If tasks finish before being cancelled, the cancellation task may be delayed. Try:

- Increasing simulation duration: `simulate_work(1, 2000).await`
- Decreasing cancellation delay: `sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await`

### Cancellation not detected

Ensure you're checking cancellation status in your work loop:

```rust
if is_simulator_cancelled() {
    return; // Exit early
}
```

### State leaking between runs

Always reset cancellation tokens before starting a new simulation:

```rust
reset_simulator_cancellation_token();
reset_global_simulator_cancellation_token();
```
