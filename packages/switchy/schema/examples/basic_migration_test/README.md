# Basic Migration Test Example

This example demonstrates how to use `switchy_schema` with the `verify_migrations_full_cycle` test utility to ensure your database migrations work correctly in both directions.

## What This Example Demonstrates

- Creating multiple migrations that build upon each other
- Using the schema query builder for database operations
- Testing migrations with `verify_migrations_full_cycle`
- Proper error handling and async migration implementation
- Working with foreign key relationships

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Rust async programming and the `tokio` runtime
- Familiarity with database migrations and why they need testing
- Understanding of foreign key relationships in relational databases

## Running the Example

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path packages/switchy/schema/examples/basic_migration_test/Cargo.toml
```

This will:

1. Create an in-memory SQLite database
2. Run the migration test using `verify_migrations_full_cycle`
3. Display the results

## Expected Output

```
Basic Migration Test Example
============================

âœ… Created in-memory SQLite database
ðŸ“‹ Defined 3 migrations:
  - 001_create_users: Create users table with basic fields
  - 002_add_users_status: Add status column to users table
  - 003_create_posts: Create posts table with foreign key to users

ðŸ”„ Testing full migration cycle...
   1. Apply all migrations forward (up)
   2. Verify no errors during forward migration
   3. Apply all migrations backward (down)
   4. Verify database returns to initial state
âœ… Full migration cycle completed successfully!

ðŸŽ‰ All migrations work correctly:
   â€¢ Forward migrations create tables and indexes properly
   â€¢ Backward migrations clean up all changes
   â€¢ Database returns to initial empty state

ðŸ’¡ Key Benefits of verify_migrations_full_cycle:
   â€¢ Tests both up and down migrations
   â€¢ Ensures migrations are reversible
   â€¢ Catches migration ordering issues
   â€¢ Verifies clean rollback behavior
   â€¢ Perfect for CI/CD pipeline testing
```

## Code Walkthrough

The example defines three migrations and tests them with `verify_migrations_full_cycle`:

### 1. Define Migration Structs (src/main.rs:18-199)

Each migration implements the `Migration<'static>` trait:

```rust
struct CreateUsersTable;

#[async_trait]
impl Migration<'static> for CreateUsersTable {
    fn id(&self) -> &str { "001_create_users" }

    async fn up(&self, db: &dyn Database) -> Result<()> {
        db.create_table("users")
            .column(Column { name: "id".to_string(), ... })
            .primary_key("id")
            .execute(db).await?;

        db.exec_raw("CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email)").await?;
        Ok(())
    }

    async fn down(&self, db: &dyn Database) -> Result<()> {
        db.exec_raw("DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_email").await?;
        db.exec_raw("DROP TABLE users").await?;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### 2. Create Migration List (src/main.rs:222-226)

Collect all migrations in order:

```rust
let migrations: Vec<Arc<dyn Migration<'static> + 'static>> = vec![
    Arc::new(CreateUsersTable),
    Arc::new(AddUsersStatusColumn),
    Arc::new(CreatePostsTable),
];
```

### 3. Run Full Cycle Test (src/main.rs:238-258)

Use the test utility to verify migrations work in both directions:

```rust
verify_migrations_full_cycle(db.as_ref(), migrations).await?;
```

This function:

1. Applies all migrations forward (`up()`)
2. Verifies they succeed
3. Rolls them all back (`down()`)
4. Verifies the database returns to initial state

## Key Concepts

### verify_migrations_full_cycle

This test utility is the main focus of the example. It:

- **Tests Reversibility**: Ensures every migration can be rolled back cleanly
- **Catches Errors Early**: Detects migration issues before production
- **Validates Ordering**: Confirms migrations can be applied in sequence
- **Ensures Clean State**: Verifies rollback leaves no artifacts

### Migration Testing Patterns

Three migrations are tested together:

1. **CreateUsersTable** - Base table with unique index
2. **AddUsersStatusColumn** - Schema evolution (adding column)
3. **CreatePostsTable** - Related table with foreign key

This demonstrates testing both simple and complex migration scenarios.

### Raw SQL vs Query Builder

The example shows when to use each approach:

- **Query Builder** - For standard operations (`create_table`, `primary_key`)
- **Raw SQL** - For features not yet in the builder (`UNIQUE INDEX`, `ALTER TABLE ADD`)

## Testing the Example

The example includes unit tests demonstrating different testing patterns:

### Run All Tests

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path packages/switchy/schema/examples/basic_migration_test/Cargo.toml
```

### Individual Test Cases

1. **test_individual_migrations** - Tests a single migration in isolation
2. **test_migration_descriptions** - Validates migration metadata
3. **test_full_cycle_with_test_utils** - Full cycle test in a test context

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed"

If foreign key errors occur during rollback:

- Ensure you drop dependent tables before parent tables
- In this example, `posts` (with foreign key to `users`) must be dropped before `users`

### Error: "table already exists"

This indicates the `down()` migration didn't clean up properly:

- Verify your `down()` method drops all created objects
- Check that indexes are dropped before tables
- Use `IF EXISTS` clauses for robustness

### Migration Test Fails on Rollback

If `verify_migrations_full_cycle` fails during the down phase:

- Check that every `up()` operation has a corresponding `down()` operation
- Verify the order of cleanup operations (reverse of creation)
- Use raw `DROP` statements if query builder doesn't support the feature

### SQLite-Specific Issues

Some database features vary by engine:

- SQLite stores datetime as TEXT with special handling
- Use `DataType::Text` with `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for timestamps
- Foreign keys must be enabled in SQLite: `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`
