# MoosicBox Bloaty

**Note: This package is currently a placeholder with minimal implementation.**

## Overview

The MoosicBox Bloaty package is intended for binary size analysis but currently contains only boilerplate code.

## Current Status

- **Library**: Contains only Rust linting configuration (4 lines)
- **Implementation**: No actual functionality implemented yet
- **Features**: Planned but not yet developed

## Planned Features

The package is intended to eventually provide:

- Binary size analysis for Rust binaries
- Size optimization recommendations
- Build comparison reports
- CI integration for size regression detection

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MoosicBox/MoosicBox.git
cd MoosicBox

# Note: Currently no functionality to build
cargo build --package moosicbox_bloaty
```

## Usage

**Currently no usage available** - the package is a placeholder.

## Development Status

This package is in early planning stages. Check back later for implementation updates, or contribute to help implement the planned binary analysis features.
