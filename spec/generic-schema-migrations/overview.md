# Generic Schema Migrations - Execution Plan

## Executive Summary

Extract the generic migration logic from `moosicbox_schema` into a reusable `switchy_schema` package that any project can use for database schema evolution. This provides a foundation for HyperChad and other projects to manage their database schemas independently while maintaining full compatibility with existing MoosicBox code.

**Current Status:** 🟡 **Implementation Phase** - Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 complete, Phase 3.3 (Embedded Discovery) complete

**Completion Estimate:** ~15% complete - Core foundation, traits, and embedded discovery implemented. Directory and code discovery require significant rework.

## Status Legend

- 🔴 **Critical** - Blocks core functionality
- 🟡 **Important** - Affects user experience or API design
- 🟢 **Minor** - Nice-to-have or polish items
- ✅ **Complete** - Fully implemented and validated
- 🟡 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ❌ **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies or design decisions

## Open Questions

These items need further investigation or decision during implementation:

### Migration Ordering
- Migration ordering for identical IDs (currently uses alphabetical sorting, edge case)
- Should we validate that at least one of up.sql or down.sql exists?

### Error Recovery & Partial Migration State
- What happens if a migration fails halfway through?
- How to handle partially applied migrations?
- Should we support "dirty" state detection?
- Recovery mechanisms for corrupted migration state

### Concurrent Migration Protection
- How to prevent multiple processes from running migrations simultaneously?
- Lock mechanism (database locks, file locks, etc.)?
- Timeout handling for stuck migrations?

### Advanced Safety Features
- Production environment detection and confirmation prompts
- Backup recommendations before destructive operations
- Migration checksum validation (deferred to Phase 11.3)
- Environment-specific migration controls
- Rollback safety checks and warnings

    - [x] Check for `down.sql` file
    - [x] Read file contents as `String` (not `Bytes`)
    - [x] Handle missing files (both are optional)
    - [x] Handle empty files (treat as no-op)
    - [x] Skip directories with no SQL files entirely

- Missing files → `None`
- Empty files → `Some("")` (treated as no-op during execution)
- Directories with no SQL files are skipped entirely (not included in migration list)
- Directories with at least one SQL file create a migration
- Consistent handling: both files use the same optional pattern

### 3.6 Implement Code Discovery with Executable Integration

**Goal:** Implement code-based migrations using query builders from switchy_database with lifetime-aware traits

**Status:** ✅ Complete

#### 3.6.1 Update Core Migration Traits for Lifetimes

## Phase 4: Migration Runner

**Goal:** Core execution engine for running migrations

**Status:** ✅ **CORE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE** (Phase 4.1 and 4.2 done, 4.3 deferred)

### Implementation Notes (Added 2025-01-14)

Phase 4.1 and 4.2 have been successfully implemented with the following decisions:

#### Completed Features ✅
- MigrationRunner with configurable options and execution strategies
- Specialized constructors for all three discovery methods
- BTreeMap-based deterministic ordering
- Version tracking with migrations table
- Migration hooks system
- Dry run support
- 17 comprehensive unit tests

#### Deferred to Future Phases
1. **Dependency Resolution (4.3)** → Removed entirely
   - Not critical for initial functionality
   - Users can handle ordering themselves with naming conventions

2. **Dynamic Table Names** → Moved to Phase 12
   - Limited by switchy_database requiring `&'static str`
   - Default table name works for 99% of use cases
   - Documented limitation with error messages

3. **Transaction Support** → Moved to Phase 13
   - Requires switchy_database enhancement
   - Current implementation is still safe (fails fast on errors)

4. **Rollback Tracking** → Will be added with Phase 5
   - Infrastructure exists (down methods implemented)
   - Tracking will be added when rollback execution is implemented

### 4.1 Runner Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**

- [x] `packages/switchy/schema/src/runner.rs` - Migration runner
  - [x] Create `MigrationRunner` struct with configurable options
  - [x] Provide specific constructors: new_embedded(), new_directory(), new_code()
  - [x] Support different execution strategies (All, UpTo, Steps, DryRun)
  - [x] Use BTreeMap for deterministic ordering
  - [x] Follow moosicbox pattern: query tracking table for each migration
  - [x] If migration not found in table → execute and record it
  - [x] If migration found in table → skip (already ran)
  - [x] SQL execution via migration.up() using Executable trait
  - [x] Empty/missing migrations are recorded as successful
  - [x] Add migration hooks (before/after/error callbacks)
  - [~] Transaction management - DEFERRED to Phase 13
  - [x] NOTE: Verified switchy_database lacks transaction support

### 4.2 Version Tracking ✅ **COMPLETED**

- [x] `packages/switchy/schema/src/version.rs` - Version management
  - [x] Create standard migrations tracking table (default: `__switchy_migrations`)
  - [x] Exact schema matching moosicbox: name (Text), run_on (DateTime)
  - [~] Support configurable table names - LIMITED (see implementation notes)
  - ~~[ ] Handle rollback tracking~~ - DEFERRED to Phase 5

## Phase 5: Rollback Support

**Goal:** Simple, safe rollback functionality

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (2025-01-14)

**Note:** Down migrations are already implemented in all discovery methods. This phase adds the execution logic and tracking.

### 5.1 Rollback Engine ✅ **COMPLETED**

- [x] Add rollback() method to MigrationRunner ✅ **IMPORTANT**
  - [x] Support rollback strategies:
    - [x] Last: Roll back the most recent migration
    - [x] DownTo(id): Roll back to (but not including) a specific migration
    - [x] Steps(n): Roll back N migrations
    - [x] All: Roll back all applied migrations
  - [x] Use reverse chronological order (most recent first)
  - [x] Validate down() methods exist before attempting rollback
  - [x] Support dry-run to preview what would be rolled back
  - [x] Integration with existing MigrationRunner and hooks system

### 5.2 Rollback Tracking (Simplified) ✅ **COMPLETED**

- [x] Update VersionTracker for simple rollback tracking ✅ **IMPORTANT**
  - [x] When migration is successfully rolled back:
    - [x] Execute migration.down()
    - [x] DELETE the row from __switchy_migrations table
  - [x] This makes the migration eligible to run again if needed
  - [x] No schema changes required to the tracking table
  - [x] Maintains principle: "migrations table shows what's currently applied"

**Implementation Notes (Added 2025-01-14):**

✅ **Core Features Implemented:**
- `RollbackStrategy` enum with all required variants (Last, DownTo, Steps, All)
- `MigrationRunner::rollback()` method with full strategy support
- `VersionTracker::get_applied_migrations()` - returns migrations in reverse chronological order
- `VersionTracker::remove_migration()` - deletes migration records during rollback
- Built-in validation through migration source lookup and down() execution
- Dry-run support via existing `self.dry_run` flag
- Full integration with hooks system (before/after/error callbacks)
- Comprehensive test coverage (3 new test functions, all 20 unit tests + 10 doc tests passing)

✅ **Zero Compromises Made:**
- All Phase 5.1 and 5.2 requirements implemented exactly as specified
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Follows established patterns and conventions
- Proper error handling and rollback on failure

**Rationale:** Simple deletion approach is cleaner than complex rollback status tracking. The migrations table always reflects the current state of applied migrations.

## ~~Phase 6: Validation & Safety~~ ❌ **REMOVED**

~~**Goal:** Comprehensive validation to prevent migration issues~~

**Status:** ❌ **REMOVED** - Validation features deemed unnecessary for core functionality:
- Migration IDs can be any valid string (no naming convention needed)
- Checksum validation moved to Phase 11.3 (Future Enhancements)
- Dependency resolution removed entirely (users handle ordering themselves)
- Advanced safety features moved to Open Questions section

    - [ ] Verify rollback preserves/restores initial state
    - [ ] Add unit tests for this functionality

  - [ ] **Interleaved state mutations** - Test with data changes between migrations:
    ```rust
    pub async fn verify_migrations_with_mutations<M>(
        db: &dyn Database,
        migrations: Vec<Box<dyn Migration>>,
        mutations: M
    ) -> Result<(), MigrationError>
    where M: MutationProvider
    ```
    - [ ] Support mutations via:
      - [ ] Raw SQL strings
      - [ ] `Box<dyn Executable>` (query builders)
      - [ ] Arbitrary closures: `FnOnce(&dyn Database) -> Result<(), DatabaseError>`
    - [ ] Execute mutations between specific migrations
    - [ ] Verify migrations handle intermediate state changes
    - [ ] Verify rollback works with mutated data
    - [ ] Add unit tests for this functionality

### 7.4 Mutation Provider Trait

- [ ] `packages/switchy/schema/test_utils/src/mutations.rs` - Mutation handling ❌ **IMPORTANT**
  - [ ] Define `MutationProvider` trait:
    ```rust
    pub trait MutationProvider {
        async fn get_mutation(&self, after_migration_id: &str)
            -> Option<Box<dyn Executable>>;
    }
    ```
  - [ ] Implement for common patterns:
    - [ ] `BTreeMap<String, Box<dyn Executable>>` - Map migration IDs to mutations (NOT HashMap!)
    - [ ] `Vec<(String, Box<dyn Executable>)>` - Ordered list of mutations
    - [ ] Builder pattern for constructing mutation sequences
  - [ ] Add unit tests for each implementation

### 7.5 Test Assertion Helpers

- [ ] `packages/switchy/schema/test_utils/src/assertions.rs` - Test assertions ❌ **IMPORTANT**
  - [ ] Table existence verification
  - [ ] Column presence/type verification
  - [ ] Row count assertions
  - [ ] Data integrity checks
  - [ ] Migration state verification (which migrations are applied)
  - [ ] Schema comparison utilities
  - [ ] All functions return `Result<(), DatabaseError>` or propagate existing errors
  - [ ] Add unit tests for assertion helpers

### 7.6 Documentation and Examples

- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation ❌ **MINOR**
  - [ ] Usage examples in module docs
  - [ ] Example test cases showing all three verification methods
  - [ ] Document feature flags and when to use them

**Key Design Decisions:**
- No custom error types - Propagate existing `MigrationError` and `DatabaseError`, with optional thin wrapper only if needed
- User provides database - Test utilities accept `&dyn Database`, don't create databases themselves
- Feature-gated SQLite helper - `create_empty_in_memory()` only available with `sqlite` feature
- BTreeMap over HashMap - Always use `BTreeMap` for deterministic ordering
- Tests alongside implementation - Each component gets unit tests as it's built, not separately

**Implementation Notes (Added 2025-01-14):**

✅ **Phase 7.1 and 7.2 Completed Successfully:**
- Package structure follows exact pattern from `hyperchad_test_utils`
- `TestError` wrapper type implemented for clean error propagation
- SQLite feature enables both `switchy_database_connection` dependency and `sqlite-sqlx` feature
- `create_empty_in_memory()` uses `init_sqlite_sqlx(None)` for in-memory database creation
- Zero clippy warnings with full pedantic linting enabled
- Comprehensive documentation with proper backticks and error sections
- Workspace integration at correct locations (line 118 members, line 274 dependencies)

## Success Metrics

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: moosicbox_schema continues to work unchanged
- **Database Agnostic**: Works with SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL via switchy_database
- **Type Safe**: Leverages Rust's type system for compile-time safety
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new migration sources and strategies
- **Well Tested**: >90% test coverage with integration tests
- **Functional**: Core functionality works correctly with basic tooling

## Technical Decisions

### Why Extract from moosicbox_schema?
- Enables independent schema management for HyperChad
- Creates reusable component for other projects
- Maintains existing functionality while adding flexibility
- Follows single responsibility principle

### Why Use Trait-Based Design?
- Enables both SQL and code-based migrations
- Provides type safety and compile-time validation
- Allows for extensible migration sources
- Integrates well with Rust's async ecosystem

### Why Support Multiple Sources?
- Embedded: Zero-config deployment with compile-time validation
- Directory: Development flexibility and runtime migration loading
- Code: Type-safe migrations with complex logic
- Remote: Future extensibility for distributed systems

### Migration Ordering Strategy
- Timestamp-based naming for deterministic ordering
- Dependency system for complex migration relationships
- Simple timestamp-based ordering for deterministic execution
- Clear error messages for ordering conflicts
