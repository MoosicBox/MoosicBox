# Generic Schema Migrations - Execution Plan

## Executive Summary

Extract the generic migration logic from `moosicbox_schema` into a reusable `switchy_schema` package that any project can use for database schema evolution. This provides a foundation for HyperChad and other projects to manage their database schemas independently while maintaining full compatibility with existing MoosicBox code.

**Current Status:** üü° **Implementation Phase** - Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 mostly complete

**Completion Estimate:** ~15% complete - Core foundation and traits implemented

## Status Legend

- üî¥ **Critical** - Blocks core functionality
- üü° **Important** - Affects user experience or API design
- üü¢ **Minor** - Nice-to-have or polish items
- ‚úÖ **Complete** - Fully implemented and validated
- üü° **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ‚ùå **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies or design decisions

## Open Questions

These items need further investigation or decision during implementation:

### Database-Specific SQL Handling
- How should we handle SQL differences between databases (postgres/sqlite/mysql)?
- Should we enforce database-specific subdirectories like moosicbox does?

### Migration Ordering
- Migration ordering for identical timestamps (currently undefined behavior)

### Error Recovery & Partial Migration State
- What happens if a migration fails halfway through?
- How to handle partially applied migrations?
- Should we support "dirty" state detection?
- Recovery mechanisms for corrupted migration state

### Concurrent Migration Protection
- How to prevent multiple processes from running migrations simultaneously?
- Lock mechanism (database locks, file locks, etc.)?
- Timeout handling for stuck migrations?

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
switchy_database = { workspace = true }
async-trait = { workspace = true }
thiserror = { workspace = true }
include_dir = { workspace = true, optional = true }
chrono = { workspace = true }


[features]
default = ["embedded"]
embedded = ["include_dir"]
directory = []
code = []
all-discovery = ["embedded", "directory", "code"]
validation = []
test-utils = []
```

## Execution Order

### Prerequisites
- switchy_database package stable and available
- Understanding of existing moosicbox_schema patterns
- Test database infrastructure available

### Phase Dependencies
1. **Phase 1** (Package Creation) - No dependencies, must be done first
2. **Phase 2** (Core Types) - Requires Phase 1 complete
3. **Phase 3** (Discovery) - Requires Phase 2 complete
4. **Phase 4** (Runner) - Requires Phases 2-3 complete
   - NOTE: Verify switchy_database transaction support
5. **Phase 5** (Rollback) - Requires Phase 4 complete
6. **Phase 6** (Validation) - Requires Phase 4 complete
7. **Phase 7** (moosicbox Migration) - Requires Phases 2-6 complete
8. **Phase 8** (Testing) - Can parallel with development phases
9. **Phase 9** (Migration Listing) - Requires Phases 2-3 complete
10. **Phase 10** (Documentation) - Can parallel with all phases
11. **Phase 11** (Future Enhancements) - After all core phases complete

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Core types and discovery can be developed simultaneously
- Validation can proceed in parallel with rollback development
- Migration listing can be developed alongside other phases
- Documentation can be written as features are implemented
- Testing can be developed incrementally with each phase

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Breaking existing moosicbox_schema functionality
**Mitigation:** Maintain moosicbox_schema as thin wrapper, comprehensive compatibility tests

### Risk: Complex dependency resolution
**Mitigation:** Start with simple timestamp ordering, add dependencies incrementally

### Risk: Database-specific migration differences
**Mitigation:** Leverage switchy_database abstractions, test across all database types

### Risk: Performance impact of new abstraction layer
**Mitigation:** Benchmark against existing implementation, optimize hot paths

### Risk: Migration state corruption
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive validation, atomic operations, backup recommendations

## Next Steps

1. Create `packages/switchy/schema/` package directory and workspace integration
2. Implement core types and traits for migration system
3. Add feature-gated discovery modules for different migration sources
4. Create migration runner with transaction support
5. Add rollback support and validation features
6. Update `moosicbox_schema` to use switchy_schema internally
7. Add comprehensive testing with robust test utilities
8. Implement migration listing functionality
9. Validate HyperChad integration and provide usage examples
