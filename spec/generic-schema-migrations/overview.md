# Generic Schema Migrations - Execution Plan

## Executive Summary

Extract the generic migration logic from `moosicbox_schema` into a reusable `switchy_schema` package that any project can use for database schema evolution. This provides a foundation for HyperChad and other projects to manage their database schemas independently while maintaining full compatibility with existing MoosicBox code.

**Current Status:** 🟢 **Core Implementation Complete** - Phases 1-5 and 7 (including all sub-phases 7.1-7.6) complete, ready for moosicbox_schema migration (Phase 8)

**Completion Estimate:** ~45% complete - Core foundation, traits, discovery methods, migration runner, rollback, Arc migration, comprehensive test utilities with full examples completed. Ready for moosicbox integration.

## Status Legend

- 🔴 **Critical** - Blocks core functionality
- 🟡 **Important** - Affects user experience or API design
- 🟢 **Minor** - Nice-to-have or polish items
- ✅ **Complete** - Fully implemented and validated
- 🟡 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ❌ **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies or design decisions

## Open Questions

These items need further investigation or decision during implementation:

### Migration Ordering
- Migration ordering for identical IDs (currently uses alphabetical sorting, edge case)
- Should we validate that at least one of up.sql or down.sql exists?

### Error Recovery & Partial Migration State
- What happens if a migration fails halfway through?
- How to handle partially applied migrations?
- Should we support "dirty" state detection?
- Recovery mechanisms for corrupted migration state

### Concurrent Migration Protection
- How to prevent multiple processes from running migrations simultaneously?
- Lock mechanism (database locks, file locks, etc.)?
- Timeout handling for stuck migrations?

### Advanced Safety Features
- Production environment detection and confirmation prompts
- Backup recommendations before destructive operations
- Migration checksum validation (deferred to Phase 11.3)
- Environment-specific migration controls
- Rollback safety checks and warnings

### Implementation Notes (Added 2025-01-14)

Phase 4.1 and 4.2 have been successfully implemented with the following decisions:

#### Completed Features ✅
- MigrationRunner with configurable options and execution strategies
- Specialized constructors for all three discovery methods
- BTreeMap-based deterministic ordering
- Version tracking with migrations table
- Migration hooks system
- Dry run support
- 17 comprehensive unit tests

#### Deferred to Future Phases
1. **Dependency Resolution (4.3)** → Removed entirely
   - Not critical for initial functionality
   - Users can handle ordering themselves with naming conventions

2. **Dynamic Table Names** → Moved to Phase 12
   - Limited by switchy_database requiring `&'static str`
   - Default table name works for 99% of use cases
   - Documented limitation with error messages

3. **Transaction Support** → Moved to Phase 13
   - Requires switchy_database enhancement
   - Current implementation is still safe (fails fast on errors)

4. **Rollback Tracking** → Will be added with Phase 5
   - Infrastructure exists (down methods implemented)
   - Tracking will be added when rollback execution is implemented

### 4.1 Runner Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**

- [x] `packages/switchy/schema/src/runner.rs` - Migration runner
  - [x] Create `MigrationRunner` struct with configurable options
  - [x] Provide specific constructors: new_embedded(), new_directory(), new_code()
  - [x] Support different execution strategies (All, UpTo, Steps, DryRun)
  - [x] Use BTreeMap for deterministic ordering
  - [x] Follow moosicbox pattern: query tracking table for each migration
  - [x] If migration not found in table → execute and record it
  - [x] If migration found in table → skip (already ran)
  - [x] SQL execution via migration.up() using Executable trait
  - [x] Empty/missing migrations are recorded as successful
  - [x] Add migration hooks (before/after/error callbacks)
  - [~] Transaction management - DEFERRED to Phase 13
  - [x] NOTE: Verified switchy_database lacks transaction support

### 4.2 Version Tracking ✅ **COMPLETED**

- [x] `packages/switchy/schema/src/version.rs` - Version management
  - [x] Create standard migrations tracking table (default: `__switchy_migrations`)
  - [x] Exact schema matching moosicbox: name (Text), run_on (DateTime)
  - [~] Support configurable table names - LIMITED (see implementation notes)
  - ~~[ ] Handle rollback tracking~~ - DEFERRED to Phase 5

## Phase 5: Rollback Support

**Goal:** Simple, safe rollback functionality

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (2025-01-14)

**Note:** Down migrations are already implemented in all discovery methods. This phase adds the execution logic and tracking.

### 5.1 Rollback Engine ✅ **COMPLETED**

- [x] Add rollback() method to MigrationRunner ✅ **IMPORTANT**
  - [x] Support rollback strategies:
    - [x] Last: Roll back the most recent migration
    - [x] DownTo(id): Roll back to (but not including) a specific migration
    - [x] Steps(n): Roll back N migrations
    - [x] All: Roll back all applied migrations
  - [x] Use reverse chronological order (most recent first)
  - [x] Validate down() methods exist before attempting rollback
  - [x] Support dry-run to preview what would be rolled back
  - [x] Integration with existing MigrationRunner and hooks system

### 5.2 Rollback Tracking (Simplified) ✅ **COMPLETED**

- [x] Update VersionTracker for simple rollback tracking ✅ **IMPORTANT**
  - [x] When migration is successfully rolled back:
    - [x] Execute migration.down()
    - [x] DELETE the row from __switchy_migrations table
  - [x] This makes the migration eligible to run again if needed
  - [x] No schema changes required to the tracking table
  - [x] Maintains principle: "migrations table shows what's currently applied"

**Implementation Notes (Added 2025-01-14):**

✅ **Core Features Implemented:**
- `RollbackStrategy` enum with all required variants (Last, DownTo, Steps, All)
- `MigrationRunner::rollback()` method with full strategy support
- `VersionTracker::get_applied_migrations()` - returns migrations in reverse chronological order
- `VersionTracker::remove_migration()` - deletes migration records during rollback
- Built-in validation through migration source lookup and down() execution
- Dry-run support via existing `self.dry_run` flag
- Full integration with hooks system (before/after/error callbacks)
- Comprehensive test coverage (3 new test functions, all 20 unit tests + 10 doc tests passing)

✅ **Zero Compromises Made:**
- All Phase 5.1 and 5.2 requirements implemented exactly as specified
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Follows established patterns and conventions
- Proper error handling and rollback on failure

**Rationale:** Simple deletion approach is cleaner than complex rollback status tracking. The migrations table always reflects the current state of applied migrations.

## ~~Phase 6: Validation & Safety~~ ❌ **REMOVED**

~~**Goal:** Comprehensive validation to prevent migration issues~~

**Status:** ❌ **REMOVED** - Validation features deemed unnecessary for core functionality:
- Migration IDs can be any valid string (no naming convention needed)
- Checksum validation moved to Phase 11.3 (Future Enhancements)
- Dependency resolution removed entirely (users handle ordering themselves)
- Advanced safety features moved to Open Questions section

## Phase 7: Testing Infrastructure ✅ **COMPLETED** (All sub-phases 7.1-7.6 finished 2025-01-14)

    - ✓ All examples include comprehensive Cargo.toml files and runnable code
    - ✓ Examples show realistic migration scenarios with proper error handling
  - [x] Document feature flags and when to use them (sqlite feature documented)

**Implementation Details (Added 2025-01-14):**

✅ **Phase 7.6 Completed Successfully - Comprehensive Examples Created:**

**Three Full-Featured Migration Test Examples:**
1. **`basic_migration_test`** (`packages/switchy/schema/examples/basic_migration_test/`)
   - Demonstrates `verify_migrations_full_cycle` for simple up/down testing
   - Shows basic table creation with schema query builder
   - Includes proper workspace metadata and README documentation

2. **`state_migration_test`** (`packages/switchy/schema/examples/state_migration_test/`)
   - Demonstrates `verify_migrations_with_state` for data preservation testing
   - Shows adding columns with default values to existing tables
   - Validates data integrity through migration cycles
   - Includes test module with `FilterableQuery` trait usage

3. **`mutation_migration_test`** (`packages/switchy/schema/examples/mutation_migration_test/`)
   - Demonstrates `verify_migrations_with_mutations` for comprehensive testing
   - Implements custom `MutationProvider` for dynamic test scenarios
   - Tests migrations against various database states
   - Includes test module with `MutationProvider` trait usage

**Key Implementation Decisions:**
- **Schema Query Builder Usage**: All examples use modern `switchy_database` schema builder API where supported
- **Hybrid Approach**: Raw SQL used only for ALTER TABLE and CREATE INDEX (not yet supported by builder)
- **Workspace Consistency**: All examples use `edition = { workspace = true }` for 2024 edition
- **Documentation**: Each example includes comprehensive README.md with usage instructions
- **Test Coverage**: Examples include test modules demonstrating real-world usage patterns
- **Trait Imports**: Test modules properly import required traits (`FilterableQuery`, `MutationProvider`)

**Workspace Improvements:**
- Updated all example packages to use workspace inheritance for edition
- Added `readme = "README.md"` field to all example Cargo.toml files
- Created comprehensive README documentation for all examples and test utilities
- Fixed clippy warnings including collapsible if statements
- Ensured all packages follow consistent metadata patterns

**Key Design Decisions:**
- No custom error types - Propagate existing `MigrationError` and `DatabaseError`, with optional thin wrapper only if needed
- User provides database - Test utilities accept `&dyn Database`, don't create databases themselves
- Feature-gated SQLite helper - `create_empty_in_memory()` only available with `sqlite` feature
- BTreeMap over HashMap - Always use `BTreeMap` for deterministic ordering
- Tests alongside implementation - Each component gets unit tests as it's built, not separately

**Implementation Notes (Added 2025-01-14):**

✅ **Phase 7.1, 7.2, and 7.2.5 Completed Successfully:**
- Package structure follows exact pattern from `hyperchad_test_utils`
- `TestError` wrapper type implemented for clean error propagation
- SQLite feature enables both `switchy_database_connection` dependency and `sqlite-sqlx` feature
- `create_empty_in_memory()` uses `init_sqlite_sqlx(None)` for in-memory database creation
- **Arc migration completed**: All migration types now use `Arc<dyn Migration>` instead of `Box<dyn Migration>`
- Zero clippy warnings with full pedantic linting enabled
- Comprehensive documentation with proper backticks and error sections
- Workspace integration at correct locations (line 118 members, line 274 dependencies)
- **Ready for Phase 7.3**: Test utilities can now easily clone migrations via Arc

✅ **Phase 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 Completed Successfully (2025-01-14):**
- **Complete Query Builder Integration**:
  - Used ORM-style query builder for all SELECT operations
  - Used insert builder for all INSERT operations
  - Only `exec_raw` for PRAGMA commands (no query builder support available)
- **Schema Builder Integration**:
  - Enabled `schema` feature for `switchy_database`
  - All CREATE TABLE operations use `db.create_table().column().execute()` pattern
  - Updated all doc examples to showcase modern schema builder API
- **Test Assertion Helpers**:
  - 10 assertion functions covering tables, columns, rows, migrations, and schema
  - All functions return `Result<(), DatabaseError>` for clean error propagation
  - Comprehensive doc examples with schema builder usage
- **Error Handling**:
  - Used `i64::try_from().expect()` with proper panic documentation
  - Clean `TestError` propagation throughout test utilities
  - No incorrect error type mappings
- **Test Coverage**:
  - 23 unit tests passing (table existence, column validation, row counts, etc.)
  - 17 doc tests passing (all assertion function examples)
  - Zero clippy warnings with full pedantic linting
- **Zero Compromises**: Achieved all requirements using modern APIs where available

**Key Technical Decisions for Phase 7.5:**
1. **Complete Query Builder Integration**:
   - Used ORM-style query builder for all SELECT operations
   - Used insert builder for all INSERT operations
   - Only `exec_raw` for PRAGMA commands (no query builder support available)
2. **Schema Builder Integration**: Added `schema` feature to leverage modern table creation API
3. **Error Conversion Strategy**: Used `try_from().expect()` for integer conversions with documented panic conditions
4. **Intentional `exec_raw` Usage**:
   - PRAGMA commands: SQLite-specific, no query builder support exists
   - Migration test utilities: Testing raw SQL migrations requires raw SQL execution (by design)
5. **Test Organization**: Kept all assertions in single module for simplicity
6. **Feature Gating**: All assertions require `sqlite` feature to ensure database availability

**Out of Scope for Phase 7:**
- Schema diffing tools
- Testing against different database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL) - user provides the database
- Production database testing utilities

### Technical Implementation Notes

**Clippy Compliance:**
- All packages pass `cargo clippy --all-targets` with zero warnings
- Full pedantic linting enabled across all packages
- Workspace-wide consistency for metadata inheritance

**Schema Query Builder Integration:**
- Examples demonstrate best practices using `switchy_database` schema builder
- Raw SQL only used where builder doesn't yet support operations (ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX)
- All data operations use modern query builder syntax

**Test Infrastructure:**
- Test modules require proper trait imports for extension methods
- `FilterableQuery` trait needed for `where_eq` and similar methods
- `MutationProvider` trait needed for mutation testing functionality
- All examples include runnable test code with proper async/await patterns

### 7.2.5 Migration Type Update to Arc ✅ **COMPLETED**

- [x] Update core migration types from `Box<dyn Migration>` to `Arc<dyn Migration>` ✅ **CRITICAL**
  - [x] Update `MigrationSource` trait return type:
    ```rust
    async fn migrations(&self) -> Result<Vec<Arc<dyn Migration<'a> + 'a>>>;
    ```
    - ✓ Changed from `Box<dyn Migration>` to `Arc<dyn Migration>`
  - [x] Update all MigrationSource implementations:
    - ✓ `EmbeddedMigrationSource` - uses `Arc::new()` instead of `Box::new()`
    - ✓ `DirectoryMigrationSource` - uses `Arc::new()` instead of `Box::new()`
    - ✓ `CodeMigrationSource` - updated return type signature
  - [x] Update `MigrationRunner` to work with Arc:
    - ✓ Internal BTreeMap uses `Arc<dyn Migration>`
    - ✓ `apply_strategy` method signature updated
    - ✓ All test cases updated to use `Arc::new()`
  - [x] Update documentation examples:
    - ✓ Added `std::sync::Arc` imports to all doc examples
    - ✓ Updated all type signatures in documentation
    - ✓ All doc tests pass
  - [x] Verify compatibility:
    - ✓ All 20 unit tests pass
    - ✓ All 10 doc tests pass
    - ✓ Zero clippy warnings
    - ✓ No breaking changes to public API

**Arc Migration Benefits:**
- **Cheap cloning**: `Arc::clone()` just increments reference count
- **Clean test utilities**: No RefCell, unsafe code, or complex ownership patterns
- **Shared ownership**: Multiple test utilities can share the same migrations
- **Zero compromises**: All existing functionality preserved

## Phase 8: moosicbox_schema Migration

**Prerequisites:** ✅ All Phase 7 sub-phases complete with comprehensive test coverage and examples

**Current Status:** Phase 8.1 ✅ Complete | Phase 8.2-8.5 ❌ Not Started

**Goal:** Transform `moosicbox_schema` from a custom migration implementation (~260 lines) to a thin wrapper around `switchy_schema` (~150 lines), while maintaining 100% backward compatibility and gaining new features like rollback support.

### 8.1 Enable Custom Table Names in switchy_schema

**Goal:** Remove the artificial limitation preventing custom migration table names

- [x] Update VersionTracker Methods ✅ **CRITICAL**
  - [x] Update `packages/switchy/schema/src/version.rs`:
    - [x] Remove limitation check from `ensure_table_exists()` - use `&self.table_name`
    - [x] Remove limitation check from `is_migration_applied()` - use `&self.table_name`
    - [x] Remove limitation check from `record_migration()` - use `&self.table_name`
    - [x] Remove limitation check from `get_applied_migrations()` - use `&self.table_name`
    - [x] Remove limitation check from `remove_migration()` - use `&self.table_name`
    - [x] Update all documentation to remove "Limitations" sections
    - [x] Remove TODO comments about switchy_database limitations

- [x] Add Convenience Method to MigrationRunner ✅ **CRITICAL**
  - [x] Update `packages/switchy/schema/src/runner.rs`:
    - [x] Add `with_table_name(impl Into<String>)` method for easy configuration
    - [x] Update documentation to show custom table name usage

- [x] Test Custom Table Names ✅ **IMPORTANT**
  - [x] Add test case using custom table name
  - [x] Verify migrations work with non-default table names
  - [x] Ensure backward compatibility with default table name

### Phase 8.1 Implementation Notes (Completed)

**Key Implementation Details:**
- ✅ Removed limitation checks from all 5 methods (`ensure_table_exists`, `is_migration_applied`, `record_migration`, `get_applied_migrations`, `remove_migration`)
- ✅ Now uses `&self.table_name` instead of `DEFAULT_MIGRATIONS_TABLE`
- ✅ Removed all "Limitations" documentation sections
- ✅ Removed TODO comments about switchy_database limitations
- ✅ Added `with_table_name(impl Into<String>)` method
- ✅ Updated module documentation with custom table name usage example
- ✅ Method integrates cleanly with existing builder pattern
- ✅ Added `test_custom_table_name()` unit test
- ✅ Added `test_custom_table_name_integration()` integration test with actual database
- ✅ Added `switchy_database_connection` as dev dependency
- ✅ All 23 tests pass including 2 new tests
- ✅ Verified backward compatibility with default table name

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests verify the API works correctly
- Integration test creates actual SQLite database and runs migrations with custom table name
- Test verifies both the custom migration tracking table and the actual migrated tables exist

**No Compromises Made:**
- Every requirement was implemented exactly as specified
- No workarounds or hacks needed
- Clean, maintainable code that follows existing patterns

### 8.2 Core moosicbox_schema Implementation

**Prerequisites:** ✅ Phase 8.1 complete - custom table names fully supported

**Goal:** Replace custom migration logic with switchy_schema while keeping the same API

**Important Design Note**: The implementation intentionally runs both PostgreSQL and SQLite migrations when both features are enabled. This is not a bug - it's designed for development/testing scenarios. In production, only one database feature is ever enabled, so only one set of migrations runs. This behavior must be preserved for compatibility.

- [ ] Implement Unified Migration Functions ❌ **CRITICAL**
  - [ ] Rewrite `packages/schema/src/lib.rs` with unified functions:
    - [ ] Add `switchy_schema` dependency with `embedded` feature to Cargo.toml
    - [ ] Add `switchy_env` dependency for environment variable support
    - [ ] Keep existing dependencies that are still needed (include_dir, log, thiserror)
    - [ ] Define core types and constants (`MIGRATIONS_TABLE_NAME`)
    - [ ] Implement single `migrate_config()` function with internal feature-gated blocks for both databases
    - [ ] Implement single `migrate_library()` function with internal feature-gated blocks for both databases
    - [ ] Implement single `migrate_library_until()` function with internal feature-gated blocks for both databases

- [ ] Implement Database Migration Logic ❌ **CRITICAL**
  - [ ] Within each unified function:
    - [ ] Use `include_dir!` to embed migration directories for both databases
    - [ ] Add `#[cfg(feature = "postgres")]` block using `MigrationRunner::new_embedded()` with PostgreSQL directories
    - [ ] Add `#[cfg(feature = "sqlite")]` block using `MigrationRunner::new_embedded()` with SQLite directories
    - [ ] Implement `ExecutionStrategy::UpTo` support for `migrate_library_until()`
    - [ ] Implement `MOOSICBOX_SKIP_MIGRATION_EXECUTION` environment variable support
    - [ ] Use custom table name: `__moosicbox_schema_migrations` for all migrations

### 8.3 Backward Compatibility Layer

**Goal:** Ensure existing code and tests work without modification

- [ ] Implement Compatibility Types and Exports ❌ **CRITICAL**
  - [ ] Keep `MigrateError` type for backward compatibility
  - [ ] Implement `Migrations` struct for test compatibility:
    - [ ] Add `run()` method that wraps `MigrationRunner` with custom table name
    - [ ] Add `run_until()` method with migration name support
  - [ ] Maintain feature-gated module structure for constants only:
    - [ ] `#[cfg(feature = "sqlite")]` module with `SQLITE_CONFIG_MIGRATIONS` and `SQLITE_LIBRARY_MIGRATIONS` constants
    - [ ] `#[cfg(feature = "postgres")]` module with `POSTGRES_CONFIG_MIGRATIONS` and `POSTGRES_LIBRARY_MIGRATIONS` constants
    - [ ] Functions remain at root level (not in modules)

### 8.4 Testing & Validation

**Goal:** Ensure all existing functionality works correctly

- [ ] Verify Existing Tests ❌ **CRITICAL**
  - [ ] Run and ensure all existing tests pass without modification:
    - [ ] `sqlx_config_migrations` test
    - [ ] `sqlx_library_migrations` test
    - [ ] `rusqlite_config_migrations` test
    - [ ] `rusqlite_library_migrations` test
    - [ ] `test_api_sources_table_migration` test (complex migration test)

- [ ] Test New Features ❌ **IMPORTANT**
  - [ ] Add test for rollback functionality (new capability!)
  - [ ] Add test for dry-run mode
  - [ ] Add test for migration hooks
  - [ ] Verify environment variable support still works

- [ ] Migration Order Verification ❌ **IMPORTANT**
  - [ ] Ensure migrations run in same order as before (alphabetical by ID)
  - [ ] Verify `run_until` stops at correct migration
  - [ ] Test that already-applied migrations are skipped

### 8.5 Documentation & Cleanup

**Goal:** Document changes and remove obsolete code

- [ ] Code Cleanup ❌ **MINOR**
  - [ ] Remove old `walk_dir` implementation
  - [ ] Remove old `as_btree` implementation
  - [ ] Remove manual migration tracking logic
  - [ ] Clean up unused imports
  - [ ] Remove `moosicbox_assert` dependency if no longer needed

- [ ] Documentation Updates ❌ **MINOR**
  - [ ] Update package README with new architecture
  - [ ] Document new features available (rollback, dry-run, hooks)
  - [ ] Add examples showing how to use new rollback capability
  - [ ] Document that no changes are needed to calling code

### Success Criteria

- [x] Custom table names work in switchy_schema (Phase 8.1) ✅
- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] Migration table remains `__moosicbox_schema_migrations`
- [ ] Migration order is preserved (alphabetical by ID)
- [ ] `run_until` functionality works correctly
- [ ] Environment variable support maintained
- [ ] No changes required to calling code (server/src/lib.rs, events/profiles_event.rs)
- [ ] **build.rs remains unchanged and continues to trigger recompilation on migration changes**
- [ ] When both features are enabled, both migration sets run (maintaining current behavior)
- [ ] Functions compile without warnings when all features are enabled
- [ ] Single unified API regardless of feature combination

### Benefits of This Migration

1. **Code Reduction**: ~260 lines → ~150 lines (42% reduction)
2. **New Features**:
   - ✅ Rollback support
   - ✅ Dry-run mode
   - ✅ Migration hooks
   - ✅ Better error handling
   - ✅ Comprehensive test utilities
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Single migration system to maintain
4. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing code continues to work
5. **Better Testing**: Can leverage switchy_schema_test_utils

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Risk**: Different migration ordering
   - **Mitigation**: Both use BTreeMap with alphabetical sorting

2. **Risk**: Table name incompatibility
   - **Mitigation**: ~~Phase 8.1 enables custom table names~~ ✅ RESOLVED - Custom table names fully working

3. **Risk**: Test failures
   - **Mitigation**: Compatibility layer maintains exact same API

4. **Risk**: Missing environment variable support
   - **Mitigation**: Explicitly handle in wrapper implementation

5. **Risk**: Accidentally "fixing" the dual-migration behavior
   - **Mitigation**: Document that running both migrations when both features are enabled is intentional for development/testing


### Note on Callers
No changes needed! The two places that use moosicbox_schema will continue to work exactly as before:
- `packages/server/src/lib.rs` - calls `migrate_config()`
- `packages/server/src/events/profiles_event.rs` - calls `migrate_library()`

## Phase 9: Migration Listing

**Goal:** Provide ability to list available migrations

### 9.1 List Implementation

- [ ] Query API for migration state ❌ **MINOR**
  - [ ] Check if specific migration is applied
  - [ ] Get list of pending migrations
  - [ ] Get migration history
  - [ ] Separate from MigrationRunner for focused API

### 11.6 Snapshot Testing Utilities

- [ ] Snapshot testing infrastructure for migration verification ❌ **MINOR**
  - [ ] **Schema Snapshots**
    - [ ] Capture database schema state after each migration
    - [ ] Normalize schema representation across database types
    - [ ] Compare schema evolution over time
    - [ ] Detect unintended schema changes
  - [ ] **Migration Sequence Snapshots**
    - [ ] Record the full sequence of migrations applied
    - [ ] Track migration ordering and dependencies
    - [ ] Useful for debugging migration issues
  - [ ] **SQL Statement Snapshots** (optional)
    - [ ] Capture actual SQL executed by migrations
    - [ ] Review what changes migrations make
    - [ ] Detect database-specific SQL differences
  - [ ] **Data Snapshots** (complex - consider deferring)
    - [ ] Capture data state at specific points

  - [ ] Implement proper migration ordering (BTreeMap-based)
  - [ ] Add comprehensive tests for code-based migration functionality
  - [ ] Update documentation with working examples

### 11.8 Ergonomic Async Closure Support for Test Utilities

**Goal:** Improve the ergonomics of `verify_migrations_with_state` to avoid requiring `Box::pin`

**Current Issue:** Users must write `|db| Box::pin(async move { ... })` which is verbose and non-intuitive

**Potential Solutions to Evaluate:**

#### Option 1: Dual Function Approach
- [ ] Create `verify_migrations_with_sync_setup` for simple synchronous setup ❌ **MINOR**
- [ ] Keep `verify_migrations_with_async_setup` for complex async cases
- **Pros:** Clear separation, optimal for each use case
- **Cons:** API duplication, more functions to maintain

#### Option 2: Builder Pattern
- [ ] Create `MigrationTest` builder with `.with_setup()` method ❌ **MINOR**
- [ ] Builder handles the boxing internally
- **Pros:** Fluent API, extensible for future options
- **Cons:** More complex API, departure from current simple functions

#### Option 3: Helper Function (`setup_fn`)
- [ ] Add `setup_fn()` helper that wraps closure and returns boxed future ❌ **MINOR**
- [ ] Users write `setup_fn(|db| async move { ... })`
- **Pros:** Minimal API change, backward compatible, clear intent
- **Cons:** Still requires wrapping, though more discoverable than `Box::pin`

#### Option 4: Trait-Based Approach
- [ ] Define `SetupFn` trait that auto-implements for async closures ❌ **MINOR**
- [ ] Trait implementation handles boxing internally
- **Pros:** Most ergonomic, no wrapping needed
- **Cons:** Complex trait bounds, potential compilation issues

**Recommendation:** Defer decision until we have more real-world usage patterns. The current `Box::pin` approach is standard in the Rust async ecosystem and well-understood by developers.

## ~~Phase 12: Migration Dependency Resolution~~ ❌ **REMOVED**

~~**Goal:** Advanced dependency management for complex migration scenarios~~

**Status:** ❌ **REMOVED** - Dependency resolution deemed unnecessary:
- Users can handle migration ordering themselves using naming conventions
- Adds unnecessary complexity to the core package
- Most migrations don't require complex dependencies
- Ordering can be managed through migration IDs (e.g., timestamp prefixes)

## Phase 12: Dynamic Table Name Support

**Goal:** Enable truly configurable migration table names

**Status:** Not started

**Blocker:** Requires enhancement to switchy_database to support dynamic table names

### 12.1 Database Enhancement

- [ ] Enhance switchy_database to support dynamic table names ❌ **CRITICAL**
  - [ ] Add query_raw and exec_query_raw methods that return data
  - [ ] OR: Add runtime table name resolution to existing methods
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

### 12.2 Version Tracker Update

- [ ] Update VersionTracker to use dynamic table names ❌ **IMPORTANT**
  - [ ] Remove current limitation/error messages
  - [ ] Full support for custom table names
  - [ ] Update all database operations to use dynamic names

## Phase 13: Transaction Support

**Goal:** Add transaction isolation for migration execution

**Status:** Not started

**Blocker:** Requires transaction support in switchy_database

### 13.1 Database Transaction Support

- [ ] Add transaction support to switchy_database ❌ **CRITICAL**
  - [ ] begin_transaction() method
  - [ ] commit() method
  - [ ] rollback() method
  - [ ] Nested transaction support (savepoints)

### 13.2 Runner Transaction Integration

- [ ] Update MigrationRunner to use transactions ❌ **IMPORTANT**
  - [ ] Per-migration transactions (default)
  - [ ] Batch transaction mode
  - [ ] Configurable transaction strategies
  - [ ] Proper error handling and rollback on failure

## Success Metrics

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: moosicbox_schema continues to work unchanged
- **Database Agnostic**: Works with SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL via switchy_database
- **Type Safe**: Leverages Rust's type system for compile-time safety
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new migration sources and strategies
- **Well Tested**: >90% test coverage with integration tests
- **Functional**: Core functionality works correctly with basic tooling

## Technical Decisions

### Why Extract from moosicbox_schema?
- Enables independent schema management for HyperChad
- Creates reusable component for other projects
- Maintains existing functionality while adding flexibility
- Follows single responsibility principle

### Why Use Trait-Based Design?
- Enables both SQL and code-based migrations
- Provides type safety and compile-time validation
- Allows for extensible migration sources
- Integrates well with Rust's async ecosystem

### Why Support Multiple Sources?
- Embedded: Zero-config deployment with compile-time validation
- Directory: Development flexibility and runtime migration loading
- Code: Type-safe migrations with complex logic
- Remote: Future extensibility for distributed systems

### Migration Ordering Strategy
- Timestamp-based naming for deterministic ordering
- Dependency system for complex migration relationships
- Simple timestamp-based ordering for deterministic execution
- Clear error messages for ordering conflicts

```

## Execution Order

### Prerequisites
- switchy_database package stable and available
- Understanding of existing moosicbox_schema patterns
- Test database infrastructure available

### Phase Dependencies
1. **Phase 1** (Package Creation) - ✅ Complete
2. **Phase 2** (Core Types) - ✅ Complete
3. **Phase 3** (Discovery) - ✅ Complete
4. **Phase 4** (Runner Core) - ✅ Complete (4.1, 4.2)
5. **Phase 5** (Rollback) - Requires Phase 4 complete
6. **Phase 6** (Validation) - Requires Phase 4 complete
7. **Phase 7** (moosicbox Migration) - Requires Phases 4-6 complete
8. **Phase 8** (Testing) - Can proceed now
9. **Phase 9** (Migration Listing) - Can proceed now
10. **Phase 10** (Documentation) - Can proceed now
11. **Phase 11** (Future Enhancements) - After core phases
12. **Phase 12** (Dynamic Table Names) - Requires switchy_database enhancement
13. **Phase 13** (Transaction Support) - Requires switchy_database enhancement

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Core types and discovery can be developed simultaneously
- Validation can proceed in parallel with rollback development
- Migration listing can be developed alongside other phases
- Documentation can be written as features are implemented
- Testing can be developed incrementally with each phase

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Breaking existing moosicbox_schema functionality
**Mitigation:** Maintain moosicbox_schema as thin wrapper, comprehensive compatibility tests

### Risk: Migration ordering conflicts
**Mitigation:** Use timestamp-based naming conventions, clear documentation on ordering

### Risk: Database-specific migration differences
**Mitigation:** Leverage switchy_database abstractions, test across all database types

### Risk: Performance impact of new abstraction layer
**Mitigation:** Benchmark against existing implementation, optimize hot paths

### Risk: Migration state corruption
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive validation, atomic operations, backup recommendations

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create `packages/switchy/schema/` package directory and workspace integration
2. ✅ Implement core types and traits for migration system
3. 🔄 Add feature-gated discovery modules for different migration sources
   - ✅ Embedded discovery (Phase 3.3) - Complete
   - ❌ Directory discovery (Phase 3.5) - Complete reimplementation needed
   - ❌ Code discovery (Phase 3.6) - Complete reimplementation with IntoSql integration needed
4. Create migration runner with transaction support (Phase 4)
5. Add rollback support and validation features (Phase 5-6)
6. Update `moosicbox_schema` to use switchy_schema internally (Phase 7)
7. Add comprehensive testing with robust test utilities (Phase 8)
8. Implement migration listing functionality (Phase 9)
9. Validate HyperChad integration and provide usage examples (Phase 10)
