# P2P Integration - Execution Plan

## Executive Summary

Implement a P2P (peer-to-peer) communication system as an alternative to the existing centralized tunnel server architecture. This provides direct device-to-device connections using the Iroh library, with automatic NAT traversal and improved performance, while maintaining backward compatibility during migration.

**Current Status:** 🟡 **Phase 0 - Planning** - Specification being drafted

**Completion Estimate:** ~0% complete - Initial specification phase

## Status Legend
