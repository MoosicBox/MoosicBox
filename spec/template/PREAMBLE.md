# [Feature Name] - Preamble

[Opening paragraph explaining the current limitation/problem that this feature addresses. Should be 2-3 sentences about the existing system's constraints]

This specification outlines the implementation of [feature name and primary benefit]. The solution leverages [technology/approach] to provide [key advantages], eliminating the need for [previous limitation] while improving [key improvement areas].

The [feature name] will be implemented as [architectural approach - e.g., "a new package", "an enhancement to existing", etc.]. This approach allows for [flexibility/testing/future benefits] while maintaining [important constraints like backwards compatibility].

The implementation will [describe deployment/rollout strategy]. The system is designed to be [key architectural principle - e.g., "a complete alternative", "fully backwards compatible", etc.].

## Prerequisites

- Follow MoosicBox coding conventions (BTreeMap/BTreeSet, workspace dependencies)

## Context

- Specs use checkboxes (`- [ ]`) to track progress
- Four-phase workflow: preliminary check → deep analysis → execution → verification
- NO COMPROMISES - halt on any deviation from spec
    - Includes comprehensive test coverage for all business logic
    - Tests must be written alongside implementation, not deferred
    - Both success and failure paths must be tested
- Living documents that evolve during implementation
- After completing a checkbox, 'check' it and add details under it regarding the file/location updated as PROOF

See `[feature-name]/plan.md` for the current status and what's next to be done.
